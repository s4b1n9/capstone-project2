            <h2 >Where I'm from / Who I am</h2>
            <p>I'm married since 2015, no children. I live in Stuttgart (Germany) but I was born and raised in Freiburg (Germany). So my first language ist german, but still I wanted to write my website in english so that more people can read it and also give me their opinion on my work.<br/>2020 I decided to quit my job at a newspaper and start over new. The pandemic unfortunatly put my plans on hold for two years. The good thing though - it really gave me time to figure out what kind of work I want to do and what skills i would need to polish and also what i would need to learn. With the help of the employment center I was able to take classes in Web-Development, Photoshop, InDesingn, Illustrator and also SEO/SEM so that I can now aim for a job as a Developer.</p>

            <h2 >What I like</h2>
            <p>I really enjoy learning new things and getting inspired by all kinds of stuff. For example: I decided to upholster my old sofa, simply because I couldn't find one that I loved and was affordable. Let me tell you it's a challenge but brings me also great joy.<br/>I'm kind of a "jack of all trades but a master of none" if you get what I mean (≧▽≦)</p>
