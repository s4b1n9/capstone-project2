            <p>I already mentioned on my mainpage that the resume is written in german.<br/> I don't think this will be a problem because you're still able to tell what my skills are. Also you can see that I started my commercial apprenticeship in 2005 and ever since I've been in the very same company - just different departments over the years. I always wanted to learn more but when I reached the point where I couldn't further improve there, that was the time where I decided I had to go. I'm excited to see what waits for me. \^o^/</p>
